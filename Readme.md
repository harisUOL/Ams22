1. Introduction
Attendance Management System is a web application developed for daily student attendance in colleges. If facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. The attendance will be marked by the teachers for a particular class. Each teacher will be given a separate user name and password. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. Automatic reports on student’s attendance will be generated at the end of session or in between of the session.

1.1 Purpose 
The purpose of this SRS document is to specify the application requirements of the Attendance Management System. It will explain the purpose and features of the application, the interfaces of the application, what the application will do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the software will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for both the end users and the developers of the application.

This project aims to computerize the traditional attendance system where attendance is marked manually. Digitalization of the system would also help in better visualization of the data using graphs to display the no. of students’ attendance records, and total classes attended by each student. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement for the traditional attendance system.

1.4 Product Scopes
This system allows the teacher to maintain an attendance record of the classes to which he/she is teaching. With the help of this system, teachers should be in a position to generate a cumulative report for a student’s attendance for the session that has collapsed yet. Even students can access their attendance status. A better interpretation of records using graphs is a key feature of this application. The goal is to provide the professors an easy, portable solution to attendance record maintenance and attendance statistics.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The Attendance Management System is intended to replace the manual model of attendance 
record keeping by
means of roll call and paper records. The roll call and paper records are replaced with a single 
interaction
between the professor and the Attendance Management System. Professors will be able to 
view details regarding attendance of individual students on their  PC and quickly maintain 
attendance records. The features expressed in this Software Requirements Specification 
document are intended to be fully implemented in version 1.0. The
system will be developed in such a way to provide easy addition of enhanced features, which 
may be
desired in subsequent versions

The attendance maintenance system replaces the traditional, manual attendance system, which reduces a lot of paperwork. The teacher should be able to easily mark each student’s attendance and view attendance records on his/her laptop. This is the primary feature of this system. Student can also see their attendance stats by entering information such as roll no, course code, section and year of the course. They will get a visual representation of their attendance.

2.2 Product Functions
    • The main feature of the Attendance Management System is that it keeps the attendance records of each individual student. 
    • At the end of the specified period reports are generated.
    • Teachers can easily mark the attendance for the students.
    • The system allows the teachers and the students to view the pertinent statistics on student’s attendance records for the specified class.

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
There are primarily two users that would be using the application: 

Professors/Teachers: A professor or the teacher is a faculty member of the college. There are many faculty members in the institution and it is estimated that almost all the members are going to utilize the Attendance Management System. Now each professor can have one or more than one class. Their interaction with the system will be almost on daily basis. The professors are allowed to view the attendance record of any student at any time.

Student: The number of students will be obviously greater than the number of professors accessing the application. They can access their current attendance status at any time. However, they can’t make any changes to the records. They can just view them.
2.4 Operating Environment

2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
AS-1:	The database mentioned withing this Software Requirements Specification document is previously administered with the correct information needed by the Attendance Management System.

AS-2:	For attendance policies, since the professors do not usually tabulate tardiness, it is assumed that a student is either present or absent. 

AS-3:	The system also assumes the detail regarding each student would be made correctly.

DE-1:	Class data being used for setup and student recognition is dependent on the information database administered outside of the capabilities of the Attendance Management System.

DE-2:	Statistics on student attendance are dependent on a professor’s consistent utilization of the system or each lecture.
3. External Interface Requirements
3.1 User Interfaces
